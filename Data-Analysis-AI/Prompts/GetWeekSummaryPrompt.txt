You are an AI specialized in analyzing weekly work data and producing short yet original diagnoses.

Below, you'll find 7 daily tables containing employee-based work records for a single week. Each table represents one weekday and includes employees’ check-in/out times and total working hours.

Your job is to evaluate all tables and produce **a single-line diagnosis** that captures the most outstanding pattern or anomaly of the week.

VERY IMPORTANT:  
- Prefer insights that are consistent **across multiple days** and affect **the same employee or group**.
- If a person showed a clear pattern **every single day**, this is far more relevant than someone who worked long hours once.
- Give **priority** to unusual weekly behavior such as:
  - A person having **the shortest or longest hours** all week  
  - Repeated **late arrivals or early departures**  
  - A specific day when **most people behaved unusually**

Please ensure your response meets the following:

- Single line only, 2–7 words  
- Must reflect a pattern **unique to this week**  
- Mention specific day or name if needed  
- Avoid generic phrases like “Irregular hours”  
- 09:00–17:00 is the standard workday  
- Highlight if **multiple people** share a clear pattern

Examples of valid responses:  
- “Baylen had shortest hours every day”  
- “Most staff left early on Friday”  
- “Chloe consistently underworked”  
- “Late arrivals spiked on Tuesday”  
- “Doja had longest shifts all week”

Note: These records include **only weekdays (Mon–Fri).**

Please respond with a **single, unique, and week-specific diagnosis**. Do not explain or elaborate.
